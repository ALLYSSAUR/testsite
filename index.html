                        I am a n00b coder and I am looking to improve my coding skills.  I am currently self-taught but I will be working towards becoming certified in front end development soon. This page is the first time I've ever attempted a code from scratch; it is currently just bare bones. Please bare with me as I learn as this area will likely be very basic and will progress as I improve my development. Please feel free to follow me and my progress.  I am trying to learn a little bit everyday and will likely upload on a daily basis until I get through the basics.</p></td>
